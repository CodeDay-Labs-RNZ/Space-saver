                            language(s) are Java, and as of late Typescript. I have a foundation in Javascript, and MySQL, with some foundations
                            in Linux environments. I believe in no person left behind, and always strive to make sure everyone's voice is heard,
                            and know that a ship runs better when everyone is on the same page.</h2>
